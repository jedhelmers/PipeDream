# PipeDream
MS's old Pipe Dream... in vanilla JS

In a nutshell, this is a vanilla JS Pipe Dream class that can be imported into other JS frameworks for building the UI.

The grid starts as null. As pieces are placed, those nulls are replaced with 1's and 0's. When the draining starts, it begins at the start piece then snakes along the path of 1's.
